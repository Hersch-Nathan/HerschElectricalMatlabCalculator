# Undergrad Student at University of Kentucky studying Electrical Engineering and Theatre. 
# This is my ongoing project to create a library of functions for circuit analysis for both DC and AC system. This project will be expanded as I take upper level classes. Currently, I am taking Intro to Electronics, Signals and Systems, and Electromechanics. Expect relevant functions from those classes to be added.
